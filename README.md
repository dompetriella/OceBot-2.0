# ocebot2_0

Improved version of the old ocebot app.  Keeps track of weight variations for Ocelot (hognose snake)

Mostly a proof of concept for using Riverpod and Firestore, but it's a fun little thing to practice UX

(Not really for public use since it's pretty specific to Ocelot, but feel free to fork!)
